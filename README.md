##Editing the file

It's a markdown file in this repository
now you have two branches, main and readme-edits. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.
These changes will be made to just the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from main.
